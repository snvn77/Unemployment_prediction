Predicting U.S. Unemployment Trends Using Time Series and Deep Learning Models

Dataset & Features
The dataset includes historical monthly data on:

Unemployment Rate (%)
Labor Market Indicators: Civilian labor force, hires, separations
Economic Indicators: CPI, personal income, retail sales, savings rate
Manufacturing & Services PMI & Employment Index

Methods & Modeling Approaches
âœ” Time-Series Forecasting Models: SARIMAX for trend-based forecasting
âœ” Deep Learning Architectures: LSTM, Bi-LSTM for capturing sequential patterns
âœ” Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing, normalization, and lag feature creation
âœ” Model Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, MAPE for performance assessment

Key Findings
ðŸ”¹ LSTM models showed improved performance over traditional SARIMAX models for unemployment forecasting.
ðŸ”¹ Economic indicators like CPI and labor force size significantly impact unemployment trends.
ðŸ”¹ Feature selection & data preprocessing played a key role in boosting model accuracy.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statsmodels (SARIMAX)
TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM, Bi-LSTM)
Sci-kit Learn (Preprocessing, Model Evaluation)
